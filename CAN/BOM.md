# Bill Of Materials

This document outlines all of the parts that compose the CAN Bus Simulator constructed by the Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) Capstone Team. 

This bill of materials differentiates between the [essential components](#essential-components) that are required for baseline functionality of the CAN bus and the [optional components](#optional-components) that the CPS Team used to create a portable version.

## Essential Components

* (x1) 1Mbps CANable adapter (USB to CAN)
    - Brand: Jhoinrch
    - Model: RH-02
* (x9) CAN Bus Development Boards (CANBed RP2040)
    - Brand: Seeed Studio
    - Model: RP2040
* (x9) Micro USB to USB A Cables
    - They must support data transfer
* (x1) 10 Port Powered USB Hub
    - It is useful to have individual power switches for each port
* (x1) Length of CAN Bus Wire
    - A twisted pair from CAT6 ethernet cable also works
    - You need enough to connect all the boards together with the CANable adapter
* (x1) Host Computer
    - A Raspberry Pi 5 can work for this
* (x1) Keyboard
* (x1) Monitor 
    - With appropriate display cable
    - Needs to be relatively small if you want to make the simulator portable. We used a 15.6" monitor

## Optional Components

* (x1) 2017 Hyundai Sonata Dashboard
    - older or newer years may also work if they use the same DBC file
* (x1) Pelican 1510 Case
* (x1) Soldering Equipment
* (x1) Compact Powerstrip/Surge Protector
