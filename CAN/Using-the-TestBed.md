# Using the Test Bed

These instructions will guide you through the basic setup and operation of the CAN Simulator.

>Note: These instructions assume that the CAN Simulator is fully put together and running out of its portable case.  <br><br>
If you are trying to build it from scratch or something is not working properly, ensure that the initial hardware and software setup instructions have been followed. You can find them in [Initial-Setup.md](BYU-Capstone-2025-CPS\CAN\Initial-Setup.md)


## Powering It On

When you first open the carrying case, it should look like this:

Make sure everything is plugged in like it is in the photo.

There is no power button for the Raspberry Pi, so to power it on and off just plug or unplug it's usb-c power cord.

Once powered, give the Pi a few minutes to boot up. The web app for the CAN Bus Simulator should pop up automatically.

***add note about troubleshooting power issues and/or auto setup issues like not recognizing screen***
