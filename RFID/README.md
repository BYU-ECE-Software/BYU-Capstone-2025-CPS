# RFID

The RFID-EntryLab is a hands-on framework designed to expose vulnerabilities in physical access control systems. It interfaces a commercial door reader with signal analysis hardware, effectively creating a "virtual secure facility" for penetration testing.

This tool empowers students and researchers to capture raw radio frequency signals, analyze credential protocols, and execute unauthorized entry simulations by performing attacks such as credential cloning, replay attacks, and signal emulation in a safe, controlled environment.
